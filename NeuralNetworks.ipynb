    "1.   Input layer: The first layer is called the input layer. The number of nodes in the input layer is relaâ€ ed to the number of the features in our dataset.\n",
    "2.   Output layer: The final layer is called the output layer. this layer may have only one node which indicates the final out put. For example a range between 0 and 1. If the final value is close to 0 the predicted label is 0 and if it is close to 1 the second label is seleted as a result. It can also include more than one node. For example, 6 nodes for the 6 corresponding lables in our dataset. Each one have a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the probability of that label. \n",
